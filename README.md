#  Microservices Using Spring Boot for Humanitarian Aid

---

This project is a **microservices-based application built using Spring Boot** to demonstrate the practical implementation of a distributed system architecture.

The application focuses on a **humanitarian aid domain** as a use case, but it is **not dedicated to any real organization**. Instead, it serves as an **educational and technical example** of how microservices can be designed, implemented, and integrated.

The system is composed of multiple independent microservices, each responsible for a specific business capability such as **beneficiaries management** and **financial services**. Service communication and coordination are handled using **Eureka Service Discovery** and an **API Gateway**, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and loose coupling between services.

This project is intended for **learning purposes** and as a reference for developers who want to understand **microservices architecture using Spring Boot**.
