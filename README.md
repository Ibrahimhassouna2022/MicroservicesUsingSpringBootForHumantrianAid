# 🌍 Microservices Using Spring Boot for Humanitarian Aid
---
This project is a ### Microservices-based application built using Spring Boot to demonstrate the practical implementation of a distributed system architecture.
The application focuses on a humanitarian aid domain as a use case, but it is not dedicated to any real organization. Instead, it serves as an educational and technical example of how microservices can be designed, implemented, and integrated.

The system is composed of multiple independent microservices, each responsible for a specific business capability such as beneficiaries management and financial services. Service communication and coordination are handled using Eureka Service Discovery and an API Gateway, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and loose coupling between services.

This project is intended for learning purposes and as a reference for developers who want to understand microservices architecture using Spring Boot.
